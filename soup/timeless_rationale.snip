The Meaning of a Blog Post
---

Attach a timestamp to a piece of text. Present it in reverse-chronological order. Simple and effective. For almost a decade blogs have been the primary medium for inviduals to express their opinion on the internet. A blog is perfect for writing about changes: a person’s life, the society in general, the progress of a project, or other events. The readers are encouraged to frequently visit the blog in order to keep up to date, and in some blogs (these days: most blogs) they can also post comments and take a part of the discussion.

So simple and so effective that it has slowly taken over the internet, which isn’t only positive. Useful information is hidden beneath “September 2008”, but is still as relevant today. Posts with glaring mistakes are left online because all blog posts should be immutable. People forget to write down the context (in the technical world: version numbers, operation systems etc), so it’s impossible to know if the post still applies a few years later.

The blog has become the norm, even in the places where it doesn’t fit at all.

A blog that isn’t a blog
---

You might have arrived at this site under the impression that this is a blog. If so, I’m sorry to disappoint you: you won’t find any timestamps here. Why? Because I don’t want to write about changes. I don’t have what it takes to maintain a blog and post regularly. All I want to do is to write. Not often, not always, but still: there are times when I simply want to write.

If I’m not going to take advantage of the blog medium, then why should I be impeded by the disadvantages? Why do I feel I’m obliged to add a timestamp to each post? Why do I feel I’m not allowed to change or update the posts?

I feel brainwashed, and Timeless is my attempt at breaking out of the prison.

Content, not changes
---

The goal of Timeless is that every articles should be timeless. Well, not timeless in the usual meaning of the word, but timeless as in every article should include enough context to be easily understandable if you discover it a month, a year or maybe even ten years later. The article should be regularly updated as I learn and discover new aspects of the topic.

Just because Timeless focuses on content, doesn’t mean there’s no focus on the changes. I don’t expect people to manually look for changes, so I have both an RSS feed and a separate page about the recent changes at Timeless.

This gives me the perfect flexibilty: New readers can browser and explore the content like it’s a wiki, while returning readers can easily see if there’s any updated content. If you want to be notifed about further updates, you can simply subscribe to the feed, just like a normal blog.
