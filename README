                      WELCOME IN VANILLA
                                 VANILLA
                                 VANILLA
                                 VANILLA
What you've got:

  config.ru  - this is the rack configuration, which is used to start
               the application by your webserver
  config.yml - the configuration; by default it specifies the directory
               which contains the soup, and a cookie secret
  soup/      - the default soup directory, where your snips are stored
  

For an overview of vanilla, start your site and look at the tutorial:

  $ rackup   # then open http://localhost:9292/vanilla-rb-tutorial


By default, you won't be able to edit anything on the site, because
you can't log in. If you want to edit snips on the site, you'll need
to create a user.

  $ rake vanilla:add_user

Your other option is to edit the soup directly; you can edit any file
in the soup directory using your favourite editor, and the changes
will be reflected automatically. The snip files are slightly modified
YAML files. Here's one describing Soup itself, in soup/soup.yml:

  Soup is a data store supporting the {link_to snip}-space that {link_to vanilla-rb} expects.

  It's hosted on github [here][github].

The 'content' of the snip is at the top of the file, followed by

  --- # Soup attributes
  
which starts the rest of the snip attributes. Again, see the online
tutorial for information about what each attribute signifies.
